Definition Ensemble := U -> Prop.
Definition In (A:Ensemble) (x:U):= A x.
Notation "x ∈ A":= (In A x) (at level 10).
Definition Included (B C:Ensemble) : Prop := forall x:U, x∈B -> x ∈ C.
Notation "A ⊆ B":= (Included  A B)(at level 10).
Definition Union (B C:Ensemble) : Ensemble := fun x:U => (x∈B) \/ (x∈C).
Notation "A ∪ B":= (Union  A B)(at level 8).
Definition Intersection (B C:Ensemble) : Ensemble :=fun x:U => (x∈B) /\ (x∈C).
Notation "A ∩ B" := (Intersection  A B) (at level 10).

Rewrite goal using the definition of Included.
Fix an arbitrary element x.
Assume (x ∈ (A ∩ (B ∪ C))) then prove (x ∈ ((A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C))).

Consider cases based on disjunction in hypothesis Hyp1 .
Prove (x ∈ (A ∩ B)) in the disjunction.
Rewrite goal using the definition of (In, Intersection).
Prove the conjunction in the goal by first proving (x ∈ A) then (x ∈ B).
